- Clone the git repo. It contain train and test sets
- Main dataset is present in google drive since its 2Gb in size or can be taken from this https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/25276#participate-get_starting_kit download public data
- Run Parent.py which outputs results of Chi-square tests and P-values and Anova f-measure and Kendall coefficient results and runs hypertuning on 3 classifiers prints scores on     test set and classification report for ensemble model
  Preprocessing code is commented in Parent.py file to save time. Uncommenting will run code on main dataset.
